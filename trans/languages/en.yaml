If no champion name is included, Orianna will fall back to the default champion of the current Discord server, or show an error message if there is no default champion configured.

  To see someone else's mastery, simply mention their name in the command.

  Examples:
  - `@Orianna Bot points mf` - shows your mastery on Miss Fortune
  - `@Orianna Bot score lee @molenzwiebel` - shows molenzwiebel's mastery on Lee Sin

  This command shows you an overview of your Orianna Bot profile, computed from data gathered from all accounts you have linked from Orianna. To see your own profile, simply use `@Orianna Bot profile`.

  To see someone else's profile instead, simply mention them in the message. Note that that user will have to have linked accounts with Orianna.

  If you would like to hide your ranked tiers or account usernames, you can do so by changing the privacy settings in your [web dashboard](https://orianna.molenzwiebel.xyz/me).

# Refresh command.
command_refresh_small_description: "Update your data and recalculate your roles."
command_refresh_description: |-
  This command will manually trigger a full refresh of your mastery and ranked statistics across all of your linked accounts. In particular, the following things will be updated:
  - All your linked accounts will be checked for name changes or region transfers.
  - All your ranked tiers will be refreshed.
  - All your champion mastery values and levels will be refreshed.

  After updating all values, Orianna will recompute your roles in every server you share with her, potentially adding or removing roles based on the new values.

  Note that you do not need to manually refresh. Orianna will periodically update your statistics automatically, so this command should only be used if you have any changes that you want to see immediately.

  If you want to refresh someone else's scores, simply mention them when invoking the command (e.g. `@Orianna Bot refresh @b1nzy#0001`).

# Roles command.
command_roles_small_description: "Shows all roles configured on the current server."
command_roles_description: |-
  Shows all the roles and their requirements as configured on the current Discord server. This will list all roles, along with an indication of whether or not you are currently eligible for them.

  Note that the same role might appear twice in the list with different requirements. If this is the case, you will receive the role if you are eligible for at least one of the "sets" of conditions.

  For more information on role conditions and how they work, check out the [documentation](https://orianna.molenzwiebel.xyz/docs/conditions).

# Stats command.
command_stats_small_description: "Shows a chart detailing your mastery progression on a champion."
command_stats_description: |-
  This command generates a chart of your mastery progression based on the values periodically observed by Orianna Bot. Note that only games played after you first registered with Orianna Bot are shown.

  To graph a specific champion, simply include the name of the champion. If you want to see the stats of someone else, just mention them in the command.

  Note: Some of the values in this command, such as the winrate, are estimates based on the amount of mastery points earned for a game. They will likely not be 100% accurate.

  Examples:
  - `@Orianna Bot chart my annie progression`
  - `@Orianna Bot chart @molenzwiebel`
  - `@Orianna Bot show @molenzwiebel's stats on annie`

# Top command
command_top_small_description: "Show leaderboards and other neat statistics!"
command_top_description: |-
  This command is capable of showing a variety of leaderboards and rankings, based on either your individual score or all people linked with Orianna.

  **Champion Leaderboards**
  The most common usage is to show a leaderboard of all user's top scores on a specified champion. To do so, simply use `@Orianna Bot top <champion name>`, where champion name is any champion or [abbreviation](https://bit.ly/2wwGVMi).

  If you do not specify a champion name, Orianna will fall back to the default champion in your current server, or show an error if the server has no champion setup.

  To limit results to just people in the current Discord server, include `server` in your message.

  Examples:
  - `@Orianna Bot top mf` - shows top scores on Miss Fortune across all linked Orianna accounts
  - `@Orianna Bot top thresh server` - shows the top scores on Thresh of all current server members

  **Overall Leaderboards**
  To get a leaderboard of true champion fanatics, you can also get a leaderboard of all highest champion mastery scores regardless of champion. To do so, simply use `@Orianna Bot top all`. This command will show you all true champion fanatics, with millions of points invested into a single champion.

  To limit results to just people in the current Discord server, include `server` in your message.

  Examples:
  - `@Orianna Bot top all champions` - shows top scores of all users on any champion
  - `@Orianna Bot top all champions in this server` - shows top scores of all users in the current server

  **Personal Top Champions**
  You can also see a leaderboard of your own personal mastery scores by adding `me` to the command. Doing so will show you a list of all your champion mastery values.

  To see the leaderboard of someone else, simply mention them in your message.

  Examples:
  - `@Orianna Bot top me` - shows your top champions
  - `@Orianna Bot top @molenzwiebel` - shows molenzwiebel's top champions
